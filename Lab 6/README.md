## Overview

Build interactive systems where **multiple devices communicate over a network** using MQTT messaging. Work in teams of 3+ with Raspberry Pis.

**Parts:**
- ✅ A: Learn MQTT messaging
- ✅ B: Try collaborative pixel grid demo  
- C: Build your own distributed system

## Part A: MQTT Messaging

MQTT = lightweight messaging for IoT. Publish/subscribe model with central broker.

<details>

**Concepts:**
- **Broker**: `farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883`
- **Topic**: Like `IDD/bedroom/temperature` (use `#` wildcard)
- **Publish/Subscribe**: Send and receive messages

**Install MQTT tools on your Pi:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mosquitto-clients
```

**Test it:**

**Subscribe to messages (listener):**
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h farlab.infosci.cornell.edu -p 1883 -t 'IDD/#' -u idd -P 'device@theFarm'
```

**Publish a message (sender):**
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h farlab.infosci.cornell.edu -p 1883 -t 'IDD/test/yourname' -m 'Hello!' -u idd -P 'device@theFarm'
```

> **💡 Tips:**
> - Replace `yourname` with your actual name in the topic
> - Use single quotes around the password: `'device@theFarm'`

**🔧 Debug Tool:** View all MQTT messages in real-time at `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5001`

**💡 Brainstorm 5 ideas for messaging between devices**
> 1. **Collaborative Gaming Status:** Enable a cooperative game (like an escape room, building an object, or a collaborative puzzle) where multiple users control different items or characters. Devices publish the status of their controlled element in real-time.
> 2. **Home Monitoring Dashboard:** Create a single, unified view (like a dashboard on a tablet or web page) that displays real-time environmental data collected from various sensors and allows control of actuators. All sensors and control devices publish their status, and the dashboard subscribes to everything.
> 3. **Security Guard and Alert System:** Use door/window contact sensors to monitor entry points. When a sensor's state changes (e.g., from closed to open), the device publishes an alert. A central security hub subscribes and triggers an immediate audible alarm or sends a notification.
> 4. **Competitive Gaming (something like Sumo):** Design a competitive game (like robot sumo wrestling) where the playing area itself can detect boundaries. Use capacity or pressure sensors to define a "ring." When a character/robot is pushed outside the defined area, the ring sensor publishes the event, and the game server determines the winner.
> 5. **Social Media Collaborative Story Game:** Create a "story chain" game where each participating device/user adds the next line or paragraph to a story. When a user finishes their contribution, their device publishes the updated story fragment. All other devices subscribe to receive the latest complete story.

## Part B: Collaborative Pixel Grid

Each Pi = one pixel, controlled by RGB sensor, displayed in real-time grid.

<details>

**Architecture:** `Pi (sensor) → MQTT → Server → Web Browser`

**Setup:**

1. **Sensor**

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)
We use this sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595) for this exmaple to detect light (also RGB)
 
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-06.jpg" width=200>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector


<img src="imgs/IMG_0270.jpg" height="200" />
We need to use the screen to display the color detection, so we need to stop the running piscreen.service to make your screen available again

```bash
# stop the screen service
sudo systemctl stop piscreen.service
```

if you want to restart the screen service
```bash
# start the screen service
sudo systemctl start piscreen.service
```
 
2. **Server** (one person on laptop):
```bash
cd "Lab 6"  
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-server.txt
python app.py
```

2. **View in browser:**
   - Grid: `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5000`
   - Controller: `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5000/controller`

3. **Pi publisher** (everyone on their Pi):
```bash
# First time setup - create virtual environment
cd "Lab 6"
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-pi.txt

# Run the publisher
python pixel_grid_publisher.py
```

Hold colored objects near sensor to change your pixel!

## Part C: Make Your Own

**Requirements:**
- **✅ 3+ people, 3+ Pis:** We will use 4 Pis; one designated as the Viewer/Scorekeeper, and three others acting as Publishers (Players).
- **✅ Each Pi contributes sensor input via MQTT:** The three Player Pis will act as sensors/publishers, reporting the status of their assigned "kitchen appliance/ utensils."
- **✅ Meaningful or fun interaction:** The interaction is a rhythm-based musical game integrated with a kitchen theme.

**Ideas:**
<details><summary> Click to see some brilliant ideas :)</summary>

**Sensor Fortune Teller**
- Each Pi sends 0-255 from different sensor
- Server generates fortunes from combined values

**Frankenstories**
- Sensor events → story elements (not text!)
- Red = danger, gesture up = climbed, distance <10cm = suddenly

**Distributed Instrument**
- Each Pi = one musical parameter
- Only works together

**Others:** Games, presence display, mood ring

</details>


### Deliverables

Replace this README with your documentation:

**1. Project Description**
- What does it do? Why interesting? User experience
> The project is the detection of coordination from three different sensors on different pis which serves as the foundation for oour multiplayer cooking-themed rhythm game. Each Pi represents a different player's kitchen utensil whcih are the following:
> - A "knife/cutting-board" where a user must chops on specific places on a board
> - A "mixing bowl" where a user use a dowel to mix around the bowl at a certain speed
> - A "pan" where a user has to both manage the heat of the stove and when the take the pan off the heat <br>
> It's interesting since it is the basis of a synchronized collaborative physical cooking experiencethat is both great as a game-mechanic as well as an experience to uniquely collaborate through the cooking motions.
> Upon the synchronizatin of the physical actions (when the "knife" hits the board, "mixing bowl" is strirred, and the "pan" stove is off and "pan" is off the sove all at the same time, the system plays a victory sound)

**3. Build Documentation**

- MQTT topics used
- Code snippets with explanations

>> **Action Viewer**
> 
> The Action Viewer acts as the central game server and display. Its primary role is to subscribe to all incoming instrument status data from the Player Publishers (Pan, Mixing Bowl, Cutting Board). This component handles all received data, executes the game logic, provides feedback, and broadcasts updates to any web clients.
>
> **MQTT Messaging Details (Listener):** 
> * Broker: farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883
> * Subscribed Topic: IDD/kitchen-instrument
> * Data Format: Received data is expected to be in JSON format, containing the status information for the various kitchen instruments.
> **Code:** Lab 6/mqtt_viewer_instrument.py
> 
> The Viewer randomly generates a set of required Target Values for the Pan, Mixing Bowl, and Cutting Board instruments (e.g., a specific X range for the Mixing Bowl, a specific distance value for the Pan).
> 
> When new data is received via MQTT (identify by the utensil label), the Viewer parses the JSON message to extract the current instrument values. It then checks if the transmitted values conform to the currently active Target Values.
>
> If the received values meet the required targets, the Viewer plays the corresponding audio tone or sound effect (via speaker output); then immediately generates a new set of random Target Values, prompting the players to perform the next action in the rhythm game.

>> **Knife/ Cutting Board**
>
> ![image](imgs/cutting.jpg)
>
> This component simulates the action of chopping ingredients on a Cutting Board using a capacitive sensor. The sensor is segmented into multiple channels. The device's primary function is to continuously detect which channel is being touched and transmit this channel status data via MQTT. This simulates chopping on the correct section of the board.
> 
> **MQTT Messaging Details:** 
> * Data Source: Capacitive Sensor Channels (Channels 0–11).
> * Target Broker: farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883
> * Topic: IDD/kitchen-instrument
> 
> **Code:** Lab 6/instrument_knife_publisher.py
> The main loop reads the status of the capacitive sensor's channels (typically channels 0 through 11).
> The current channel status is formatted into a JSON object (similar to a hashmap) where the key is the channel number and the value is its state (typically 1 for touched/active, 0 for untouched/inactive). 

>> **Pan**
>
> ![image](imgs/pan.jpg)
> 
> This component simulates the action of stir-frying or cooking by using a Distance Sensor to detect the pan's proximity to a simulated "heat source" or a fixed reference point. The device's primary function is to continuously capture the distance value and transmit it via MQTT to simulate the chef controlling the pan's height.
>
> **MQTT Messaging Details:** 
> * Data Source: Distance Sensor (Numerical Value).
>     * Interpretation: A large value (e.g., $2000+$) indicates the pan is very close to the sensor/heat source. A very small value ($0, 1, 2$) indicates the pan is far away (almost nothing detected).
> * Target Broker: farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883
> * Topic: IDD/kitchen-instrument
>
> **Code:** /Lab 6/instrument_pan_publisher.py
> 
> The main loop repeatedly reads the raw numerical output from the distance sensor. The current distance value is formatted into a message (e.g., a simple numerical string or a JSON object containing the value) and published to the shared topic.


>> **Mixing Bowl**
> 
> ![image](imgs/mixing.jpg)
>
> This component simulates the action of mixing ingredients in a Mixing Bowl using a joystick as the sensor input. The device's primary function is to continuously capture the joystick's X and Y coordinates and transmit this data via MQTT.
>
> **MQTT Messaging Details:** 
> * Data Source: Joystick (X and Y axis values).
> * Target Broker: farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883
> * Topic: IDD/kitchen-instrument
> * Publish Frequency: 20 Hz (once 0.05 sec)
> **Code:** Lab 6/mixing_bowl_publisher.py
> 
> The core logic resides within the main loop. This loop reads the current X and Y values from the connected joystick.
> The X and Y values are formatted into a message (e.g., a simple string or JSON object) and published to the specified topic at a high frequency of 20 Hz to ensure near real-time tracking of the mixing motion.

**4. User Testing**
- **Test with 2+ people NOT on your team**
- Photos/video of use
- What did they think before trying?
- What surprised them?
- What would they change?
  
> **Testers: Marianne Arriola, Deviki Veerareddy**
> - Before trying, the testers could tell that it was a multi-player game pretty easily, however they did not realize it was a cooking game until we told them
> - The cutting board especially surprised one of our testers felt as if the separate tapping of the rod did not mirror the knife cutting (they didn't know what to do intuitively)
> - Both of our testers liked how the sounds played while doing the actions, however wished there was some way to play multiple sounds when multiple actions were being done (ie. chopping & mixing
> - One tester suggested a great application/extension would be to compose music using each as a instrument
> - Noticed that the pan distance sensor worked most of the time, but at times was slightly buggy
> - After revealing the intent of the final project, our testers agreed that a visual UI would be very helpful for timing and synchronization


**5. Reflection**
- What worked well?
- Challenges with distributed interaction?
- How did sensor events work?
- What would you improve?

> - The accuracy and speed of data streamed to server wokred well (sensor inputs were detected very well) and the sounds played were also pretty accurate in terms of timing with use and non-use of the sensors
> - We did face some challenges in getting all three pis to co-ordinate and switch using the shared speaker system in terms of order of usage of the different sensors due to timing and sensistivity issues as well as audio lengths
> - Each pi was assigned a specific cooking action (distance sensor -> pan, joystick -> mixing bowl, capacitator -> bowl) and all of these devices published messages to the same topic which was monitored for the speaker to know what sound to currently play
> - We hope to imporve the sensor interactions to be more complex as we are using this as a baseline initiial step for our final project
> - In addition we hope to improve the multiple sounds playing at once by playing sounds that are stacked audios of the two/three cooking utensils that are in use
> - Another aspect we hope to improve on is making the physical cutting board more realistic mimicking a single lever-style chopping motion (up-to-down) rather than requiring repeated taps across the cutting board
> - We are hoping to take this project in the direction of detecting synchronized timings and gamifying the experience we have now which would allow for a more interesting user interaction
